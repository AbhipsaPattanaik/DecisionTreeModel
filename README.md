# Heart Disease Prediction Using Decision Tree Classifier

This project aims to predict whether a person has heart disease using decision tree classification. The model is built using features such as age, sex, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. The decision tree algorithm was chosen for its ability to model non-linear relationships and interpretability.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about individuals, including their age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and whether they have heart disease. The goal is to use these features to predict the presence or absence of heart disease.

## Installation
pip install -r requirements.txt
